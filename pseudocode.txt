For each item (sub-array) in “answersArray”
	Copy the first item in pizzaArray and add to this sub-array of answersArray.
If this sub-array has less than 3 items, do the following.
Copy the first item in pizzaArray and add to the final sub-array in answersArray.
	End If statement.
Remove the first item in pizzaArray.
While the sub-array has less than 4 items, do the following.
	Select a random item from pizzaArray.

	Remove selected item from pizzaArray.
Once the sub-array has 4 items, stop loop.
Shuffle the order of the current sub-array.
End For loop
